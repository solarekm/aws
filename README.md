This repository contains a collection of scripts and tools for the AWS CLI. These scripts are designed to help automate common tasks and workflows in AWS environments.

The repository includes scripts for working with various AWS services, such as EC2, S3, RDS, and more. Additionally, there are scripts that help with deploying and managing infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation, as well as scripts for automating tasks related to monitoring and logging in AWS environments.

All scripts in this repository are free to use and modify, and I welcome contributions from the community to help improve and expand the collection of scripts.

Whether you're an experienced AWS user or just getting started, these scripts can help you save time and streamline your workflow. I hope you find them useful and welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have.
